# 🔄 Android Activity Lifecycle Demo

> A beginner-friendly Android app that demonstrates the complete lifecycle of an `Activity` using Toast messages and Logcat logs.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This Android application is designed to help developers understand the **Activity Lifecycle** in Android. It logs and displays messages each time a lifecycle method (`onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, `onRestart()`, `onDestroy()`) is called, giving a clear visual understanding of what happens when an app is launched, minimized, closed, or rotated.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔁 Shows how each lifecycle method is triggered in real time
- 📱 Uses **Toast messages** for visual feedback
- 🧾 Logs detailed messages in **Logcat**
- 🎓 Great for beginners learning Android development
